        <p class="lead">We’re building open source software to help people create a new virtual world.</p>
        <p class="lead">This starts with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>Presence</h2>
                <p>
                    We’re working with a wide variety of consumer-available motion 
                    controllers, 3D cameras, and head-mounted displays. These amazing 
                    new devices make real immersion possible, enabling virtual world 
                    residents to animate avatar movements and facial expressions in real 
                    time. Which we’ve observed leads to:
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Connection.</h2>
                <p>
                    Coupling these devices with high-speed networks and the vast computing 
                    power many of us have on tap, High Fidelity is working to capture and 
                    replicate the little details that underpin our interactions with others--things 
                    like countenance, gaze, and spatialized audio cues. Which takes us to:
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Collaboration &amp; Commerce.</h2>
                <p>
                    By borrowing computing time and bandwidth from others, virtual events 
                    can grow to any size, space or audience.  High Fidelity is developing 
                    an exchange which facilitates the lending and borrowing of computing 
                    resources, using cryptocurrency credits to recognize these transactions. 
                    These credits will be used to buy digital goods and services from others 
                    to help people build and power expansive digital worlds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The worlds created with High Fidelity can be linked together </strong>
                    by the common avatar identity and digital marketplace we are building, operating 
                    as a shared service to all users of the software platform. The open source software 
                    is not yet complete, but is available on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> 
                    for experimentation and contribution. To supplement our in-house team, we have 
                    also created a software development marketplace listing part-time paid opportunities – 
                    you can find it at <a href="https://worklist.net">worklist.net</a>
